# RunningTotal
 A simple running total app



A simple calcuation total app used for calculating all the scores.

When you press the Add button the score typed is added to the Array and then in the  tableview.

User can clear all the scores at once using the Clear Button.

User can swipe any cell in the table to delete the record in the total score.

NSNumberArray was used to save the Array and so even if the app is closed or stopped the total score is still mainatined in the data logs.
